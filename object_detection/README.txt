Contents of the Folder : 

1. saved_model :- Contains the custom-trained efficientdet model

2. test_images :- Images to test the model, a few sample images are provided by the team.

3. labelmap.pbtxt :- Contains information about the label-mapping of images, ie class_names and class_id

4. object_detection.ipynb :- Notebook file for running the code.

Follow these instructions for testing the code on your local machine:



1. Create a new folder under the name "object_detection" in your Google Drive.This folder should contain the folders/files-
   saved_model, test_images, and labelmap.pbtxt shared by the team.


2. Run the .ipynb notebook file shared by the team on Google Colab, as most of the dependancies are pre-installed in Colab.
   However, if you want to run it on your local machine, you might have to install some of the dependancies locally  which 
   shall be prompted by the code. 
   
    
3. The notebook file contains further line by line instructions to test our code as well as to add your own custom
   test images.
